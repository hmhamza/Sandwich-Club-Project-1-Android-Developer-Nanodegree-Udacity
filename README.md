# Sandwich Club
#### _Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project# 1_

### Project Overview
In this project, I completed the Sandwich Club app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

### Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.
### What I Learnt?
Through this project, I did:

- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
